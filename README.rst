A Gentle Introduction to SQL Using SQLite
-----------------------------------------

This tutorial was lovingly crafted by `Troy Thibodeaux <https://github.com/tthibo>`_ 
as a human-friendly introduction to the world of databases and SQL.

It introduces database skills fromm the ground up using
SQLite and a small set of data from the world of campaign finance.

This repo largely hews to Troy's original `SQL-Tutorial <https://github.com/tthibo/SQL-Tutorial>`_, 
but updates the material to work with *DB Browser for SQLite*.

It's home page is on RTD (TK).
