A Gentle Introduction to SQL Using SQLite
=========================================

This tutorial was crafted by `Troy Thibodeaux <https://github.com/tthibo>`_
as a human-friendly introduction to the world of databases and SQL.
It introduces database skills from the ground up using
SQLite and a small set of data from the world of campaign finance.

   This tutorial largely hews to Troy's original `SQL-Tutorial <https://github.com/tthibo/SQL-Tutorial>`_,
   but updates the material to work with *DB Browser for SQLite*.
   Source code for this tutorial lives on `Github <https://github.com/zstumgoren/gentle-intro-to-sql>`_.
