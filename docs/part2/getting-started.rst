| It should ask you if you want to open the last used database
  (**test.sql**). Click OK.
| If you do not get this option, click on the “Connect Database” icon
  (|image1|) and browse to the file you saved last time. (If you can’t
  find the file, you can recreate it by following the final step in
  `Part I <https://github.com/tthibo/SQL-Tutorial#readme>`__ of this
  tutorial.)
