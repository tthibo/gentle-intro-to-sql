Getting started
----------------

To get started, fire up *DB Browser* if you don't already have it open.

Click "Open Database" (|open_db|) and navigate to the "contributors.db" database 
you created in :doc:`../part1/first-db-and-table`. 

   Note, this db should contain 103 rows after completing the 
   :doc:`../part1/importing-data` section of the tutorial. If you skipped
   that section or can't find the file, grab a copy of the db file here: 
   :download:`contributors.db <../_data/contributors.db>`.
