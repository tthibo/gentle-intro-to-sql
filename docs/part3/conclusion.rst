Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

Congratulations! You now have a well-rounded set of SQL skills that
can help you wrangle and analyze the most ornery of datasets. SQL JOINs
in particular will help you design well-structured databases
and join to other data sets in pursuit of more sophisticated analyses.

Below are some topics we have not yet covered that are worth exploring:

* The `UNION operator <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_unions_clause.htm>`_,
  which allows you to combine results from multiple queries
* Database optimization using `indexes <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_indexes.htm>`_
* Database `views <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_views.htm>`_, which can be used to store complicated queries as a virtual table

Thanks for working through this tutorial! Please drop us a note on `Github <https://github.com/zstumgoren/gentle-intro-to-sql/issues>`_ if you have
thoughts on how the tutorial can be improved.
